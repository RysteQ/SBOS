### The why

So, I have a professor in my university that is responsible to teach me and the rest of the class about operating systems and I really liked the subject and I still do. Now you see, I failed to get a passing grade, **alongside the  80% of the class**, so I decided to make this operating system as a gift to my professor and because I really like low level programming. Also, I do not hate the professor, if anything I really like his lessons although I still feel a bit sour about the grade I got.

### How to run on a linux machine

To run the OS under an emulator you will need [Qemu](https://www.qemu.org/) and [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/), after you have those installed on your linux machine just use the make.sh file I included in the repository by typing the following command

```
> bash make.sh
```

### Future plans

I plan on improving the OS as much as I can with my limited knowledge and my depleting sanity, that includes:

1. Restructuring the code to make it easier to read
2. Improving the code
3. Adding new features

If anything my **top priority** is improving the code itself so I can make the OS smaller in size and making it more readable, after that is done I will improve the notepad application to make it more user friendly and only then I will focus on adding new features to the operating system itself.

### What is not going to be implemented in the future

There are two primary things I won't include to this OS of mine, that is making it 32 or 64bit, the second thing is any networking except for maybe a crossover ethernet cable so that two computer with this OS installed can communicate to each other although that is **very** unlikely because let's be honest with ourselves, who is going to run this OS to more than one computer ?
